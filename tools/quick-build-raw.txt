Quick Build Reference
Scum & Villainy
ship pilot upgrades threat
This reference contains the X-Wing Second Edition Quick Build options for the Scum and Villainy
faction. These predefined selections of pilots and upgrades help you quickly assemble squadrons and
get flying. Each option consists of a ship card, a number of upgrade cards, and a threat level. To play
a match using the Quick Build options, you just need to agree to a particular threat level with your
opponent, choose a combination of options that add up to that threat level, and launch your fighters!
