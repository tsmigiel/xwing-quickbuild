ship pilot upgrades threat
This reference contains the X-Wing Second Edition Quick Build options for the Separatist Alliance
faction. These predefined selections of pilots and upgrades help you quickly assemble squadrons and
get flying. Each option consists of a ship card, a number of upgrade cards, and a threat level. To play
a match using the Quick Build options, you just need to agree to a particular threat level with your
opponent, choose a combination of options that add up to that threat level, and launch your fighters!
