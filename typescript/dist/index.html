			<h1>X-Wing 2nd Edition Quick Build Printer</h1>
			<p>This page allows you to choose quick builds by
			faction, ship type, or extension, then lays them out
			for easy printing. It uses the actual card images from
			FFG. Having pre-printed quick builds reduces the setup
			time when trying to play a quick game of X-Wing.
			<h3>Instructions</h3>
			<p>Choose a faction, ship type, or extension then press the
			<i>update</i> button. Save or print using the browser's print
			command, choosing page size and layout matching the <i>Print
			Options</i>.
			<p>The approach for page layout is to generate a single pdf where
			each page is the same size and multiple builds are put on the same
			page if a simple cut will work. This is useful when using a
			printing service (e.g., Staples, FedEx) that supports simple cuts
			like "cut in half vertically, horizontally, or both". Examine the
			pdf to determine what page ranges should use what type of cuts.
			11"x17" has a more efficient layout.
