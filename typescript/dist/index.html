			<p>Choose a faction (required) and any ship types (optional) or any
			extension (optional) then press the <i>update</i> button. Save or
			print using the browser's print command.
			<p>Quick builds are layed out for an 11" wide page. For 8.5"x11",
			use landscape to have 1 quick build per page. For 11"x17", use
			portrait and 3 quick builds will be printed on each page, which can
			be cut in thirds, except for some quick builds at the start which
			require half of the 17" page.
			<p>Quick builds with generic pilots and few upgrades are repeated
			across a row so a player can use that quick build more than once.
